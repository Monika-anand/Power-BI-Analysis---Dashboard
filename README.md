# Work From Home Analysis (Interactive Dashboard using Power BI)
## Project Objective
The Work From Home (WFH) Analysis project aims to study the impact of remote work on employee salaries, job satisfaction, and promotion trends across various roles and industries.
The objective is to help organizations understand compensation trends, experience-based pay differences, and the role of flexibility and perks in attracting remote talent.
By examining factors such as job title, company type, experience level, employment type, and perks offered, the goal is to provide insights that help improve employee retention, engagement, and fair pay practices in remote environments.

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the average salary across all remote job roles?
- Which experience level (Entry, Mid, Senior, Lead) has the highest salary share?
- Which employment type (Full-time, Contract, Part-time, Internship) pays better?
- Which companies or industries offer the highest remote salaries?
- How does job satisfaction vary across experience levels?

- How do salary and experience influence employee satisfaction?
- What insights can help organizations improve their remote work strategies?

## Process
- Collected and reviewed the dataset from Kaggle.
- Cleaned data for consistency (experience levels, job roles, salary formats).
- Transformed salary values into a comparable metric (in â‚¹ and $ equivalents).
- Built pivot tables and Power BI visualizations for salary, experience, and employment type.
- Used DAX functions in Power BI to calculate key performance metrics such as Total Salary, Average Salary, Job Satisfaction Score, and Salary by Experience Level, enabling accurate and dynamic insights.
- Applied filters and slicers for company, job title, and industry to create a dynamic dashboard.
