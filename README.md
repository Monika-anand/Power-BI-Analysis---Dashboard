# Work From Home Analysis (Interactive Dashboard using Power BI)
## Project Objective
The Work From Home (WFH) Analysis project aims to study the impact of remote work on employee salaries, job satisfaction, and promotion trends across various roles and industries.
The objective is to help organizations understand compensation trends, experience-based pay differences, and the role of flexibility and perks in attracting remote talent.
By examining factors such as job title, company type, experience level, employment type, and perks offered, the goal is to provide insights that help improve employee retention, engagement, and fair pay practices in remote environments.
